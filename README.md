I am 25 years old, currently living in Maputo, Mozambique. Despite that I am a portuguese speaker, I have fluency in English too, which helped me a lot during my learning journey.

I have been working with web development since 2019, from I gained experience with Typescript, Javascript, Node.JS, Git, front-end development and user interfaces, server side applications with Golang, CI/CD and currently Docker.

Furthermore,I create content for my own blog since 2022, which is helping me to develop some important skills such as creativity, communication, community and social media management.

I also enjoy reading, whether it's a good book, manga, or comics, as well as creating drums! I believe that our personal interests contribute to a more refined perception of things and problem solving!
